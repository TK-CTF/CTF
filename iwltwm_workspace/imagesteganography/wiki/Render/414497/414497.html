<div class="wikidoc"><h2><b><u>Information</u></b></h2>
Image Steganography uses two methods to embed files and text into images:<br /><br />1) Difference - the &#39;Difference&#39; mode will output a seemingly identical image to the original input image, but this is the most noticeable mode (and thus I might remove it at a later date). By using the two images (the processed image and the original image), the &#39;Difference&#39; mode compares each pixel, computes the difference, and turns it back into a byte.<br /><br />2) Enlarge - the &#39;Enlarge&#39; mode outputs an image 4 times bigger than the input image (2 x Width, 2 x Height). By doing this, it can has 3 times the data capacity of the &#39;Difference&#39; mode, and the original image isn&#39;t required (and so this mode is the default).<br /><br />3) Embed - the &#39;Embed&#39; mode will output an almost identical image to the input image. It encodes the data in the last two bits of the red and Blue colour channels; but by doing this, only has half a byte per pixel.<br /><br />The Overall capacity of an image will depend on the algorithm, but the capacity can be increased by Scaling the Image (See Below).<br /><br /><br /><br />If anyone wants a more technical explanation, please leave a comment.<br /><br /><b>Note: The output image will be in a .png format. Do not change it to a lossy storage format like .jgp, or the data will be lost.</b><br />
<h2><b><u>Encoding</u></b></h2>
To Encode some text or a file:<br /><br />1) Select the &#39;Encode&#39; option, and select the encoding mode (Difference or Enlarge).<br />2) Drag-and-drop an image file into the text box labelled &#39;Image&#39;.<br />3a) To encode a file, check the &#39;File&#39; option, the text box will turn white (enabled). Drag and drop a file into the text box, and the location will be displayed <i>(Note: The file name is embedded along with the data)</i><br />3b) To encode some text, check the &#39;Text&#39; option, and enter the desired text into the large text box.<br />4) Finally, choose a suitable name and location for the output file, and click &#39;Start&#39;<br />
<h2><b><u>Decoding</u></b></h2>
To Decode the text or file:<br /><br />1) Select the &#39;Decode&#39; option, and select the encoding mode (Difference or Enlarge).<br />2a) If &#39;Enlarge&#39; mode is selected, Drag-and-drop the image file into the text box labelled &#39;Image&#39;.<br />2b) If &#39;Difference&#39; mode is selected, Drag-and-drop the image with the embedded data into the &#39;Image&#39; text box, and the original image into &#39;Image 2&#39; text box (it doesn&#39;t really matter which one)<br />3a) If the image is known to contain a file, select the &#39;Output to File&#39; option, and choose a folder to save the file to <i>(as mentioned earlier, the file name is embedded along with the data. If the file already exists, you will be asked to save the file under another name or location)</i><br />3b) If the image is know to contain text, select the &#39;Output Text&#39; option; the output text will be displayed in the text box.<br />4) Click the &#39;Start&#39; button to start the decoding process.<br />
<h2><b><u>Encryption</u></b></h2>
The software supports AES encryption of the data before embedding it in an image. <br /><br />To use, simply check the &#39;Encrypt&#39; check box and encode/decode an image. When encoding, you will be prompted to set a password before the encoding process begins. When decoding, you will be prompted to enter the password after the decoding process has finished. <i>(Note: If a file has been encrypted, if you don&#39;t check the &#39;Encrypt&#39; check box or enter a password when decoding, the application will throw an error: &#39;Error - Can&#39;t find the file name. The data could be corrupt, in a text format, or it could be encrypted.&#39; It&#39;s nothing bad, it just means it could contain encrypted data)</i><br />
<h2><b><u>Image Scaling</u></b></h2>
If the length of the data exceeds the image data capacity, a check box labelled &#39;Pre-Scale Image&#39; will be shown:<br /><br /><img src="http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=imagesteganography&DownloadId=227021" alt="227021" title="227021" /><br /><br />If you click &#39;Start&#39; and this check box is checked, the image will be scaled up 4 times larger (2 x Width, 2 x Height), allowing for more data to be stored; but it takes a bit more time to encode the data into the image.<br />
<h2><b><u>Demo</u></b></h2>
A simple demonstration: <a href=".\682a2d2c-669c-4015-a27f-b793d7eb2651">Demo Image</a><br /><br />Download the image of a tree, start Image Steganography, go to &#39;Decode&#39;, make sure the &#39;Embed&#39; mode is set, choose somewhere to output the file (another image of some trees) and click &#39;Start&#39;.</div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
